# ADTs
* ADT Interfaces:
  -  Opaque view of a data structure (eg. `typedef struct t *T`, we don't know `struct t`)
  -  Function signatures for all operations
  -  Semantics of operations (via documentation, etc)
  - A contract between ADT and clients
* ADT implementations
  - Concrete defintion of the data structures
  - Function implementations for all operations

# Linked Lists
* A sequence of collection of 'nodes' holding value + pointer(s)
* No random access
* Easy to add, rearrange, remove nodes...
* List nodes references other list nodes:
  - Singly Linked List: `next`
  - Doubly Linked List: `next` `prev`

* Operations
  - Insertion ~ O(N)
  - Deletion ~ O(N)
  - Search ~ O(N)
  - Intersection ~ O(N+M)

# Stacks
* LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure

* List implementation:
  - Push: Append node to head of the list ~ O(1)
  - Pop: Remove and return head ~ O(1)
    ```C
    struct stack {
        struct node *head;
        struct node *tail;
        size_t size;
    };

    struct node {
        Item item;
        struct node *next;
    }
    ```

* Array Implementation
  - Allocate an array with a maximum number of elements
  - Fill items sequentially
  - Maintain a counter of the number of pushed / popped items (ie. the top)
  - Push: Increment top and set new top array index to value ~ O(1)
  - Pop: Decrement top and return the last hightest value
  - Disadvantage: Fixed size stack (Unless it's a dyanamically growing array)
    ```C
    struct stack {
        int top;
        Item *items;
    };
    ```


# Queues
* FIFO (First In First Out) data structure
* List Implementation
```C
struct queue {
    struct node *head;
    struct node *tail;
}

struct node {
    Item item;
    struct node *next;
}
```
- Insert: O(N) - without tail pointer in struct, otherwise O(1)
- Deletion: O(1)

# Analysis 
* Emperical: executing and measuring
* Theoretical: proving and deriving

* Factors:
  - Correctness: returns expected output
  - Robustness: behaves sensibly for non-valid inputs
  - Efficiency: returns results reasonably quickly
  - Clarity: clear code
  - Consistency: interface is clear & consistent

* We will only focus on **correctness** and **efficiency**.

## Testing (Correctness)
* Postel's Robustness Principle: *"Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from others"*

* TDD (Test Driven Development): write tests first, then write the function & repeat
* Regression testing: Keep a test suite and always run the tests after each update to the program

* Black-box testing: checks behaviour using only the interface (ie the ADT interface)
* White-box testing: checks internal behaviour (when we can see and test the ADT implementation)

## Complexity (Efficency)
* Algorithm runtime tends to be a function of input size
* Focus on asymptotic worst-case execution time
* Take into account all possible input ranges
* Cases: **Best Case** / **Average Case** / **Worst Case**
* Binary search example:
  * start at middle for sorted list
    * is the middle the key? if not continue
  * if item is less, we search in left range (lo, mid)
  * otherwise, we search in right range (mid+1, hi)
* Best case: O(1) ~ middle value
* Worst case:
  * t(N) = 1 + t(N/2) = log(N) + 1
  * ~ O(log n)


* Complexity Classes
  - O(1)          - Constant - Constant time execution, independant of input size.
  - O(log n)      - Logarithmic - Some divide-and-conquer algorithms with trivial split/recombine operations.
  - O(n)          - Linear - Every element of the input has to be processed
  - O(n log n)    - n-log-n - Divide and conquer algorithms, where split / recombine is proportional to input
  - O(n^2)        - Quadratic - Compute every input with every other input
  - O(n^3)        - Cubic - misery
  - O(n!)         - Factorial - what the...
  - O(2^n)        - Exponential - nope
* O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O (n^2) < O(n^3) < O (n!) < O(2^n)
  
* N^2 Algo ie. when N=1000 takes 1.2seconds, how long for
  - N=2000      x2      ->   x4         4.8 seconds
  - N=10,000    x10     ->   x100       120 seconds
  - N=100,000   x100    ->   x10000     12000 seconds
  - N=1000000   x1000   ->   x1000000   1200000 seconds
* Apply ^2 to how much times number of items increases. Multiply that number with base case.

* Tractable: have a polynomial time ('P') algorithm
* Intractable: no tractable algorithm exists (usually 'NP')
* Non-computable: no algorithm exists

# Recursion
* Base case (or stopping case): where no recursive call is needed
* Recursive case: calls the function on a smaller version of the problem.
* Steps:
  1. Solve as if you're not using recursion for basic subset of problem
  2. Use self for solving the rest
* eg. n! = (n-1)! x n
  - f(0)=1 f(1) = 1 else f(n) = n*f(n-1)
* Usually iterative and recusrive has same time complexity (ie. arry_max, binary_search)

# Trees
* Trees are branches data structures of nodes and edges with no cycles.
* Each node contains a value
* Each node has edges <=k other nodes (k = 2 for binary trees)
* Node is parent if it has outgoing edges
* Node is child if it has incoming edges
* Depth (or height) is the number of edges from the root to that node;
* A leaf is a node with no children.
* Trees can be viewed as set of nested structures
* Values in the left subtree has to be less than the node value
* Vice versa for right subtree.
* Degenerate: maximal height (n-1)
* Balanced: minimal height (log n)
  - Size: |size(L) - size(R)| < 2
  - Height: |height(L) - height(R)| < 2
* Advantages
  - Faster search O(log n) - compared with linked lists
  - Faster inseartion O(log n) - compared with array O(N)

## Binary trees
* A binary tree with n nodes has a height of at most n-1, if degenerate or least floor(log n) if balanced
* Complete binary tree have hieght ceiling(log n). 
* Insertion: balanced ~ O(log n), degenerate ~ O(n) ie. have to traverse the tree, like a llist
* Search / Deletion: balanced ~ O(log n), degenerate O(n)
* All nodes in left are less than and vice versa
* Structure determined by order of insertion

## Tree Traversals
* Depth First:
  - Pre-order traversal (NLR)
  - In-order traversal (LNR) - visits elements in sorted order - when tree is a BST.
  - Post-order traversal (LRN)
* Breath First:
  - Level-order traversal: visit node and all its children 
    - ie. Like a BFS, where you use a queue
    - basically visits each level from left to right
    - use a queue
    ```C
    void tree_level_order_traversal (Tree t)
    {
        if (!t) return;

        Queue q = newQueue(40);
        QueueJoin(q, t);
        while (!QueueIsEmpty(q)) {
            Item n = QueueLeave(q);
            printf("%d ", n->item);
            if (n->left) QueueJoin(q, n->left);
            if (n->right) QueueJoin(q, n->right);
        }

        dropQueue(q);
    }
    ```
* Tree successors (In order)
    - Case 1: node has right subtree
      -  Find the minimum (left most value) of the right sub tree
    - Case 2: no right subtree
      - TODO!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPbNCrdotA&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P&index=38&t=0s
    - Method 2: Perform an in order traversal, store in array and do a linear search for successor (very inefficient, but works)
* Deleting a node
  * Swap value with left most value from the right subtree (ie. it's successor)
  * Delete the item
  * Perform rotations (if required - ie. splay tree)

# Priority Queue (Using Heaps)
* Process in order of key or priority.
* Altered `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations
* `Enqueue`: join item with a priority.
  - FixUp operation has to be done, since we insert node at bottom.
* `Dequeue`: remove item with highest priority Q.
  - FixDown operation has to be done, since we remove top node, by swapping with last item. Last item may not be ideal canditate for top root.
## Heaps
* Commonly viewed as trees, implemented using arrays.
* Two properties to maintain:
  1. heap order property
  2. complete tree property
* Heaps have **top-to-bottom**  ordering (whereas binary trees have left to right ordering)
* Heaps are complete trees!
  - Every level is filled before adding nodes to the next level
  - Nodes in given level are filled left-to-right with ni breaks
* Arrays are good for heaps
  -  parent(i) = i/2
  -  left_child(i) = 2i
  -  right_child(i) = 2i+1
* Inserting:
  1. Add new element at the bottom-most, right-most position (to ensure complete tree property)
  2. Reorganise values along the path to the root (to ensure it maintains heap order)
    - We call this the heap fixup operation
  - O(log n)

* Deleting is a three-step process:
  1. Swap root value with bottom-most, right-most value (ie. last element of array)
  2. Remove that element
  3. Reorganise values along the path from root (to ensure it maintains heap order)
    - We call this the heap fix down operation
  - O(log n)

# Graphs
* Models relationship between items
* A graph G is a set of vertices V and edges E
  - E := {(v,w) | v,w is an element of V, (v,w) is an element of V X V}
  - Basically a set of edges [(v,w)]
  ![Graph Types](./img/gtypes.png)

* Simple graphs
  - a set of vertices
  - a set of undirected edges
  - no self loops
  - no parallel edges

* Sparcity vs Density
  - Sparcity ~ less connections between nodes
    - |E| approaches |V|
  - Density ~ more connections between nodes
    - |E| approaches |V|^2

* Subgraph: subset of vertices and associate edges
![Sub graph](./img/subgraph.png)

* Path: Sequence of connected vertices ie [(v,e) elem 1]
* Simple path: no repeating vertices
* Cycle: path with start and end vertex as the same.
  * How to find:
    * Perform a DFS.
    * Whilst performing a DFS, if visiting already visited node, then it has a cycle.

    ![Path](./img/path.png)

* Connected graph: a path exists from every node to every other node
* Tree: connected graph with no cycles
![Connected](./img/connected.png)

* Connected components: a graph that's not connected, consisting of a set of connected components.
  - ie. maximally connected subgraphs
![Components](./img/components.png)

* Spanning tree: (of graph) subgraph that connects all its verteces
* Minimum spanning tree: spanning tree that has the least total weight
* Spanning forest: (of graph) subgraph that contains all its vertices and is a set of ›trees
![Spanning](./img/spanning.png)

* Clique: complete subgraph
![Clique](./img/clique.png)


## Graph Representation
* Adjacency Matrix: |V| X |V| matrix; each cell represents an edge
![Undirected / Directed](./img/graph_rep.png)
![Adj Matrix](./img/graph_rep_adj.png)
 - Advantages:
   - Easy to implement
   - Words for graph, digraphs, weighted fraphs, multigraphs
   - Time efficient
 - Disadvantage
   - Huge space: V^2
   - Sparce graphs ~> wasted space!
   - undirected graph ~> wasted space!
   - Inefficent initialiseation / vertex- insert/delete

* Adjacency List
![Adj List](./img/graph_rep_list.png)

Operation | Matrix | List
--- | --- | ---
Space | V^2 | V + E
Initialise | O(V^2) | O(V)
Destroy | O(V) | O(E)
Insert Edge | O(1) | O(V)
Find / Remove Edge | O(1) | O(V)
Is Isolated | O(V) | O(1)
Degree | O(V) | O(E)
Is Adjaceny | O(1) | O(V) 

* Graph ADT
```C
typedef struct graph *Graph;

/** A concrete edge type. */
typedef struct edge { vertex v, w; weight n; } edge;

/** Create a new instance of a Graph. */
Graph graph_new (
    size_t max_edges, /**< maximum value hint */
    size_t max_vertices, /**< maximum value hint */
    bool directed, /**< true if a digraph */
    bool weighted /**< true if edges have weight */
);

/** Deallocate resources used by a Graph. */
void graph_drop (Graph g);
```

## Graph Search (DFS / BFS)
* Problem: Does a path exist between vertex v and w?
* Generic Solution
  - Examine vertices adjacent to `v`;
  - if any of them is `w`, we're done
  - otherwise, check all the adjacent vertices and repeat util we reach `w`

* Simple pattern:
   - Create a structure that will tell us what node to visit next.
   - Add the starting node to that structure
   - While that structure is not empty
     - Get the next vertex from that structure
     - Mark that node as visited (if it isn't visited)
     - Add Neighbours to the structure

* Depth First Search (DFS): Longest paths first ~ uses a `Stack` 
  * Keep track of
    - `count`: number of verticies traversed so far
    - `pre`: order in which vertices were visited
    - `st`: predecessor of each vertex (for spanning tree)
  * Edges traversed in all graph walks form a `spanning tree`, which has
    * edges corresponding to call-tree of recursive function
    * is the original graph sans cycles / alternate graph
    * in general, spanning tree has all vertices and a minimal set of edges to produce a connected graph (ie. no loops, cycles, parallel edges)
  * If a graph is not connected, `DFS` will produce a spanning forest
  * An edge connecting a vertex with an ancestor in the DFS tree that is not its parent is a `back edge` 
* Breath First Search (BFS): Adjacent nodes first ~ uses a `Queue` 
* Dikstra: Lowest-cost paths first

## Directed Graphs
* v -> w 
* eg. follow on twitter / instagram
* In a digraph, edges have direction, self-loops are allowed, parallel edges are allowed
* **in-degree**: number of directed edges leading into a vertex
  * **source**: a vertex with a in-degree 0;
* **out-degree**: number of directed edges leading out of a vertex
  * **sink**: a vertex with out-degree 0;
* **reachability**: indicates existence of directed graph
  * if a direct path `v`,...`w` exists
  * `w` is reachable from `v`.
* **strongly connected**: 
  * if both paths `v`,...,`w` and `w`,...,`v` exist then `v` and `w` are strongly connected
* **strongly connected**: indicates mutual reachability
  - if both paths `v`,...,`w` and `w`,...,`v` exist
  - `v` and `w` are strongly connected
* **strong connectivity**: every vertex reachable from every other vertex
* **strongly-connected component**: maximal strongly-connected subgraph
* Representations
  - Adjacency matrix ... Asymmetrix, sparese, less space efficent
  - Adjaceny List... Fairly common
  - Edge lists... Order of edge components matters
  - Linked data structures.. pointers inherently directional
  * DAGs: Directed Acyclic Graph
    - Tree like where each vertex has children
    - Graph like where child vertex may have multiple parents
    ![DAG](img/dag.png)

## Weighted Graphs
* Sometimes we need to assign a cost to a relationship between nodes (ie. distances between two map locations)
* We use geometric interpretation
  - low weight -> short edge
  - high weight -> high edge
* Sometimes weights can be negative
* Representations
  * Adj Matrix: store weight in each cell (not just bool)
    ![Example Weighted Adj Matrix](img/wgraph.png)
  * Adj List: Add weight attribute to each list node
  * Edge List: Add weight to each edge
  * Linked data structure: links become link/weight pairs
* Shortest path problem: 
    - Find the minimum cost path between two vertices
    - Edges may be directed or undirected
    - Assuming non-negative weights
* Minimum Spanning Trees
  - Find the weight-minimal set of edges that connects all vertices
  - Multiple solutions may exist
  - Assuming undirected, non-negative weighted graphs
* Shortest Path Search
  - **source-target**: shortest path from `v` to `w`
  - **single-source**: the shortest path from `v` to all other verices
  - **all-pairs**: the shortest paths for all pairs of `v`, `w`
  - Note: If no weights we use least hops
    ![SSSP](img/sssp.png)
    - Edge relaxation along edge `e` from `s` to `t`:
      - `dist[s]` is length of some path from `v` to `s`
      - `dist[t]` is length of some path from `v` to `t`
      - if `e` gives shorter path `v` to `t` via `s`, update `dist[t]` and `st[t]`.
      - basically update the distance and spanning tree if a shorter path has been found.
  - **Complexity**:
    - Using Adj List: O(E log V)
    - Using Adj Matrix: O(V^2)
    - Same as BFS/DFS but using a PQueue

## MSTs
* Applications:
  - Routing and network layout
  - Economical construction of electric power network
* Kruskal: grow many forests
  * Algo
    1. Take all edges and sort according to weight
    2. For each edge add to new graph, unless it introduces a cycle
 * Cycle checking is really expensive
 * Sorting: O(E log E)
* Prim: Maintain a connectivity frontier
  * Algo
    1. Start from any vertex s with an empty MST
    2. Choose edge not already in MST to add
        - Must not contain a self-loop
        - Must connect to a vertex already on MST
        - Must have minimal weight of all such edges
    3. Check to see whether adding the new edge brought any of the non-tree vertices closer to the MST
    4. Repeat until MST has all vertices
  * Easy Algo
    1.  Start with any edge
    2.  Choose edge with least weight
        1.  Add to MST
    3.  Check what edges connect to all visited nodes, with least weight (without visiting previously visited node)
        1.  Add to MST
        2.  GOTO (3. ~ ie. repeat until all vertices have been visited) 
  * O (E log V)
  * Basically dijkstra's SSSP algorithm

## Computability
* Hamilton Paths and Tours
  - **Hamilton path**: path in graph that visits each vertex exactly once.
  - **Hamilton tour**: hamiltonian path that's a cycle.
  - BRUTE FORCE! enumerate every possible path, and check each one
    - Hack a BFS or DFS to do it
    - Keep a counter of vertices visited in current path
    - Only accept a path if count is equal to the number of verticies
    - Must inspect every possible path in graph = (V/e)^V
    - NP problem (non-deterministic polynomial)

* Euler Paths and Tours
  - **Euler path**: path in graph that visits every edge exactly once. Starts and ends with different vertices.
    - Exactly two verticies of odd degree
  - **Euler tour**: path in graph that uses every edge of a exactly once. Starts and ends on same vertex.
    - All verties of even degree
  - Can be found in linear time

* Tractable Problems
  - Can we find a simple path connecting two vertices in a graph?
  - What's the shortest path?
  - Given two colors, can we colour every vertex in a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are the same colour?
  - Is there a clique in a given graph?

* Intractable Problems
  - What's the longest path
  - Given three colors, can we colour every vertex in a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are the same colour?
  - What's the largest clique

* Graph Isomorphism: Can we make two given graphs identical by renaming verticies?
  * No general solution exists...

# Sorting
* Analysing sorting algorithms:
    - N: number of items (hi + lo + 1)
    - C: number of comparisons between items
    - S: the number of times items are swappped
* Aim to minimise C and S
* Stable: Doesn't change relative order of elements with same key
* Inplace: Modifies original array

## Bubble Sort
* Steps:
  1. Swap adjacent nodes if left > right
  2. Repeat the above
* best: O(n^2)
* worst: O(n^2)
* stable / in place
* Adaptive (Optional - early exit if sorted) ~ best: O(n)

## Selection Sort
* Steps:
  1. Select the smallest element.
  2. Swap it with first position.
  3. Repeat above with first position increased and search boundry decreased.
* best: O(n^2)
* worst: O(n^2)
![Selection sort](img/selection.png)

## Insertion Sort
* Steps:
  1. Take the first element, insert into the first position.
  2. This is the start of our sorted sublist
  3. Take the next element, insert into the sorted sublist, in the right spot!
  4. Repeat until sorted!
![Insertion sort](img/insertion.png)

## Shell Sort
* Steps:
  1. Initialize the value of h (hilbert series)
     1. h = 1, h <= (n-1) / 9, h = (h*3) + 1
     2. ie. 1, 4, 13, 40...
  2. Divide the list into smaller sub-list of equal interval h
  3. Sort these sub-lists using insertion sort
  4. Repeat until complete list is sorted
  5. h=1 is an insertion sort
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j818Yud-ruc
![Insertion sort](img/shell.png)

## Merge Sort
* Divide and conquer
* Steps:
  1. Partion the input into two equal size parts.
  2. Recursively sort each of the partitions.
  3. Merge the two sorted partitons back together.
![Merge sort 1](img/merge1.png)
![Merge sort 2](img/merge2.png)

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSceec-wEyw
* Worst: O(n log n)
* Merge sort uses a trivial split operation
* Most of the work is done in the merge operation
  * ie. end = MIN(i + 2*m - 1, hi)

## Quick Sort
* Divide and conquer
* Partition / Pivot Steps
  1. Choose the highest index value has pivot
  2. Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot
  3. left points to the low index
  4. right points to the high
  5. while value at left is less than pivot move right
  6. while value at right is greater than pivot move left
  7. if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right
  8. if left ≥ right, the point where they met is new pivot
* Quick sort steps
  1. Make the right-most index value pivot
  2. partition the array using pivot value
  3. quicksort left partition recursively
  4. quicksort right partition recursively
![Quick Sort](./img/quick_sort_partition_animation.gif)

* Unstable
* M-O-3: use the middle value of array a[lo, mid, hi] as the pivot, where a[lo] <= a[mid] <= a[hi]
* O(log n) best case
* M-O-3 / random: O(n log n) worst & avg case

## Key-Indexed (Counting sort)
* Non-comparison
* Just access keys based on ordered values
* O(n) worst case

## Heap
* Non-comparison
* Steps:
  1. Add all items to pqueue (implemented as heap).
  2. Remove items from pqueue into original array.
* best: Ω(n log(n))
* worst: O(n log(n))
* not stable

## Radix Sort
* Non-comparison
* Only if we can decompose keys
* Sorting individually on each part of the key at a time:
  * digit by digit
![Radix Sort](img/radix.png)
* Time complexity O(kn)



# Balanced Trees
* Degenerate trees: height is at most n - 1   <- We're trying to avoid this
  - Ascending-ordered or descending ordered is a **pathalogical case**
  ![Degenerate](./img/degenerate.png)

* Balanced trees: height is at least log n
  - Size balanced: |size(t.L) - size(t.R)| < 2
  - Height balanced: |height(t.L) - height(t.R)| < 2
    ![Balanced](./img/balance.png)

* Costs for Degenerate
  - Insertion ~ O(n)
  - Search / Deletion ~ O(n)

* Costs for Balanced
  - Insertion ~ O(log n)
  - Search / Deletion ~ O(log n)

* Right and Left Rotations: primitive operations that change the balance of a tree whilst maintaining a search tree
![Rotations](./img/rotations.png)

* Partition is a way to brute force some balance into a tree, by lifting some kth index to the root.

* Global rebalancing: move the median node to the root by partitioning on `size / 2`; then left sub tree and right subtree
```C
btree_node *btree_balance_global (btree_node *tree)
{
    if (tree == NULL) return NULL;
    if (size (tree) < 2) return tree;
    tree = partition (tree, size (tree) / 2);
    tree->left = btree_balance_global (tree->left);
    tree->right = btree_balance_global (tree->right);
    return tree;
}
```
* Cost for global rebalancing
  - Dengerate ~ O(n log n)
  - Balanced ~ O(n)

* Local rebalancing: do small, incremental operations to improve the overall balance of the tree at the cost of imperfect balance

* Amortisation: do small amount of work now to avoid more work later.
* Randomisation: use randomness to reduce impact of BST worst cases.
* Optimisation: maintain structural information for performance.

* Root insertion
  - How to insert a node at the root without having to rearrage all node?
  - Do a leaf insertion and rotate the new node up the tree
  - Same complexity as leaf insertion

* Random insertion
  - We randomly choose which level to insert a node
  - Do a normal leaf insetion, most of the time. Random with certain probability
  - Do a root insertion of a value.
  - Basically randomly choosing to do a root insertion or note
  
## Splay Trees
* Root insertions can still leave us with a degenerate tree.
* Splay trees vary root-insertion by considering three levels of the tree
  - parent, child, grandchild
  - performs double-rotations based on p-c-g orientation
  ![Splay](./img/splay.png)
* Fast ACCESS TO ELEMENTS RECENTLY ACCESSED
* Don't care about balance, just want the root to be most recently accessed node.
* All operations: `O(log n)` on average / `O(n)` on worst case ~ n is number of nodes on tree
* Any sequence of `k` operations, starting from empty tree, never `>n` tree,  any tree operation takes `O(k log n)`, worst case time
* Basis: Splay trees kepted in balance with rotations (rotate left, rotate right).
* Splay trees are NOT kept perfectly balanced -> that why operations maybe `O(n)`
  * Ie. Inserting 1...n, and having to splay to root, creates a degenerate tree
## Splay tree operations
* 3 Cases for rotating:
  1. (Zig-Zag) X is a left child of a right child OR X is a right child of a left child.

  2. (Zig-Zig) X is a left child of a left child OR X is a right child of a right child.
    ![Zig Zig](img/zig-zig.png)
  3. (Zig) X is a child of the root
    ![Zig](img/zig.png)

* Search (key)
  1. Regularly to a binary search tree
    * Walk down a tree, deciding to walk left / right, until we reach k or a dead-end
    * Let X be the node where search ended, whether it contains key or not.
  2. Splay X up the tree through a sequence of rotations, so X becomes the root
  * Super fast performance when searching for same key over and over again

* Find Min / Max
  1. Keep walking to the left / right
  2. Splay last node to the root

* Insert a new key and value
  1. Insert into tree like a normal binary tree
  2. Splay new node to the root

* Remove (key)
  1. Remove a key like a normal BST.
  2. Keep track of actual node that got remove (ie. the left most value from right sub tree), we'll call it X
  3. Spay X's parent to the root

## 2-3-4 Trees
* Each node can have 3 kinds of nodes:
  * 2-nodes: 1 values ~ 2 children
  * 3-nodes: 2 values ~ 3 children
  * 4-nodes: 3 values ~ 4 children
* Each node stores three vvalues at most (from smallest to greatest)
* 2-3-4 trees grow 'upwards' from the leaves all of which are equidistant to the root.
* Self balancing data structure, commonly used to implement dictionaries.

* Always balanced; depth is `O(log n)`
![2-3-4 Trees](img/2-3-4.png)
* Worst case for depth: all nodes are 2-nodes ~ depth = log_2 n
* Best case for depth: all nodes are 4-nodes ~ depth = log_4 n

* Insertion steps
  1. Find leaf node where item belongs (via search)
  2. if node is not full (ie. order < 4), insert item in this node, order++
  3. if node is full (ie. contains 3 items)
     1. split into two 2-nodes as leaves
     2. promote middle element to parent
     3. insert item into appropriate leaf 2-node
     4. if parent is a 4-node, continue split / promote upwards
     5. if promote to root, and root is a 4-node, split root node and add new root

## Red black trees
* Representations of 2-3-4 trees
* Using BST nodes
* Gets benefits of 2-3-4 tree self-balancing on insert, delete ...
* Uses labels to tell us when to rebalance
* Rules
  * Root Property: Root node is always black
  * External Propery: Every external node is always black
  * Red Property: Children of red nodes are black
  * Depth Property: All nodes have the same black depth
* Fix cases
  * When uncle is black -> we rotate
  * When uncle is red -> we colour flip
* **Red Links**:
  * combine nodes to represent 3 and 4 nodes
  * child along red link is a 2-3-4 neighbour
* **Black Links**:
  * Ordinary child links
* Operations
  - Search: O(log n)
    - No different from regular BST
  - Insert: O(log n)
  - Remove: O(log n)

# Hash Tables
* Linked list, Tree, etc... have pretty slow insert and search operations
* They don't take advantage of cache locality
* Hashing lets us approximate
    - Arbitrary keys (ie. strings etc)
    - Map key tointo a compact range of index values
    - Store items in array, accessed by index value
    - O(1)
* What we need
  - Array of items
  - Hash function: hash(key) -> index
  - Collision resolution method (ie. when value already exists for given key)
* Properties we want for the hasing function, `h`:
  - For a table size `N`, output range is `0` to `N-1`
  - pure, deterministic `h(k,N)` ~ ie. gives same result
  - spreads key values uniformly over index range
  - cheap (enough) to compute
* Other properties we need for `h`:
  - Pre-image resistant: `h=HASH(M)`, given h, hard to pick `m`
  - Second pre-image resistant: for `HASH(m1) = HASH(m2)`, given `m1`, it's hard to find `m2`
  - Collision resistant: hard to find `m1` and `m2`
* What if two keys hash to the same index?
  - Allow for multiple items in a single location?
  - Systematically compute new indices by various probing strategies
  - Resize the array by adjusting hashing function, and rehash all values into new array
* Given `N` slots and `M` items:
  * best case: all lists have length `M/N`
  * worst case:  one list with length `M`, all other 0
* With good hash and `M <= N`, cost `O(1)`
* With good hash and `M > N`, cost `O(M/N)`
* `M/N` ratio is called **load**

* Collision Resolution
  - Chaining
    - Using a linked list
    - Using a tree (a bit more efficent O(log n) search)
  - Linear Probing
    - If table is not close to being full, there are still many empty slots, we could just use the next available slot along
      - to reach first item: O(1)
      - to reach subsequent items, depends on `load`
      - worst case: O(N)
  - Double Hash Probing
    - If key already exists, hash again and add the new value to the incremented index (ie. index = hash1(key) + hash2(key))
    - Hash1 to Hash2 should be relatively prime to each other, and to N
    - Faster than linear probing
    - MUST NEVER BE EVALUATED TO 0!!!
    - Choose a hash function:
      - P = prime number less than NSLOTS
      - steps = H_2(x) = P - (x % p)
      - Move step + h(x) ~ ie. increment steps using H_2 from original hash output
  - Resize table
    - You'll need to rehash and insert into table again.


* Performance:
  - Good HASH function is critical
  - Choosing a good N for M is critical (ie. managing the load)
  - Choosing a good resolution approach is critical
    - Linear probing is fastest, given big N!
    - Double hasing: faster for higher load, more efficient
    - Chaining: pssible for loads that are greater than 1, but degenerates

# Cool Algos
## Merge two linked lists in sorted order
```C
Node MergeLists(Node list1, Node list2) {
  if (list1 == null) return list2;
  if (list2 == null) return list1;

  if (list1.data < list2.data) {
    list1.next = MergeLists(list1.next, list2);
    return list1;
  } else {
    list2.next = MergeLists(list2.next, list1);
    return list2;
  }
}
```

## Recursive Tree Functions
```C
// Tree clone
Tree *tree_clone (Tree t)
{
  if (!t) return t;

  Tree new = malloc(sizeof(*new));
  new->item = t->item; // copy item from tree
  new->left = tree_clone(t->left);
  new->right = tree_clone(t->left);

  return new;
}

// Tree reverse
void tree_reverse (Tree t)
{
  if (!t) return;
  
  Tree tmp = t->left;
  t->left = t->right;
  t->right = tmp;

  tree_reverse (t->left);
  tree_reverse (t->right);
}

// Check if two trees are equal
bool tree_eq (Tree t1, Tree t2)
{
    if (!t1 && !t2) return true;
    if (t1 && t2) {
        return (t1->val == t2->val)
            && tree_eq (t1->left, t2->left)
            && tre_eq (t1->right, t2->right);
    }
    return false;
}

```

## Duplicate linked list
```
link list_duplicate (link l)
{
	link new;
	if (l == NULL)
		return NULL;
	new = node_new(l->item);
	new->next = list_duplicate (l->next);
	return new;
}

link dlist_duplicate (dlink l, prev)
{
	dlink new;
	if (l == NULL)
		return NULL;
	new = node_new (l->item);
    new->prev = prev;
	new->next = list_duplicate (l->next, l);
	return new;
}

```
