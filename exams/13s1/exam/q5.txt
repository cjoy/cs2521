B.

Stack implemented with a PQueue:
 - Assign highest priority to last element pushed onto stack
 - Maintain a top value, to see which item was just pushed.

Queue implement with a PQueue:
 - Maintain lowest priority to last element that'd been enqueued.
 - Reassign priorities when an element is been dequeued (this is an O(n) ~ pretty inefficent, but still works when maintaining order).
