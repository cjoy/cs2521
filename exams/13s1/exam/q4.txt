Question 4 ... COMP1927 13s1 Final Exam


A.

This sorting algorithm looks O(n^2).

cmp() looks like it's 6^2 = 36 times

However, we see that the out loop is bounded by:
 i=(0 to n-1) and the inner loop is bounded by
 j=(i+1 to n)

Hence calls to cmp is reduced by 1 on each iteration
ie. (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 15

Therefore, cmp is called 15 times.

B.

N + (N-1) + ... + 1 times


C.

Since the algorithm defininity isn't O(log n) and O(n), but better than O(n^2), I'll have to say O(n log n).


D.

(a[j] < a[min])
