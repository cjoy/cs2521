Q1. Quicksort has a worst case of O(n log n)

Q2. D

Q3. An abstract data type is a data type whose implementation is hidden, allowing users to execute operations using only function outlined in its interface. 

- Users don't need to worry implementation details
- Type and it's operations can be reused (ie. provides better code modularity)


Q4. strcpy requires you to malloc space before copying into it.

Q5. C. Quicksort will usually be better than insertion sort as the average case complexity for quick sort is O(n log n) and for insertion sort it's O(n^2)

Q7.

i) Stack.h

typedef struct stack *Stack;

Stack stackNew();
bool isEmpty(Stack stack);
void push(Stack stack, int item);
void pop(Stack stack);

ii) Stack.c

#define MAX_SIZE 100

typedef struct stack {
  int items[MAX_SIZE];
  int top;
} stack;

Stack stackNew ()
{
  Stack new = malloc(sizeof *new);
  new->top = 0;
  return new;
}

bool isEmpty (Stack stack)
{
  return stack->top == 0;
}

void push (Stack stack, int item)
{
  stack->items[stack->top++] = item;
}

void pop (Stack stack)
{
  stack->top--;
}
