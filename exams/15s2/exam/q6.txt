COMP1927 15s2 Exam Question 6 (Weighted DiGraphs)

A.
A -> B -> G -> M -> N -> P -> Q -> V
total cost: 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4 = 2.5

B.
V -> Q -> K -> J -> D -> C -> B -> A
total cost: 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.5 = 2.9

C.
No, node R can't be reached from other vertices (ie. source nodes, only containing outflows)
