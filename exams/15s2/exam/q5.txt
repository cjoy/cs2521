COMP1927 15s2 Exam Question 5 (Binary Search Trees)

A.
4 Keys compared (ie. 42, 69, 50 and 60)

B.
1 comparison, when the key is 42 (ie. the root)

C.
ciel(log (n))+1 keys would need to be compared in the worst case.

ceil(log(25))+1 = 6
ie. 5 comparisons will have to be made

For example, key 51 & 33 would result in the maximum number of comparisons.

D.
Searching for keys 15 & 40, would only require 4 comparisons at minimum

E.
Swap with the minimum, right most value from the root (ie. the root's successor). In this case, it's the node with the value 45.

F.
After right rotation,
root = 20
left child = 9
right child = 42
