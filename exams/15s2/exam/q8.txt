COMP1927 15s2 Exam Question 8 (Hash Table)

A.
Average chain length (ie. load)
load = items / slots
     = 100 / 11
Which is around 9

B.
4 comparisons will have to be made

C.
9 comparisons will have to be made

D.
O(M/N) where M = number of items and N = items inserted

E.
Two operations: Get hash (1) and Compare first chain value (1), therefore: Best Case Cost = O(1), when the item is the first chain value

F.
We want to insert keys with the same hash value.
ie. h(0) = 0, h(11) = 0, h(22) = 0 ....

for (i = 0, i < 100*11; i += 11){
    insertKey(h, i);
}
